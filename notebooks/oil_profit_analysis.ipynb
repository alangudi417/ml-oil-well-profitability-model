    "You work at the oil extraction company OilyGiant. Your task is to find the best locations to open 200 new oil wells. To complete this task, you must perform the following steps:\n",
    "-\tRead the files containing parameters collected from oil wells in the selected region: crude quality and reserve volume.\n",
    "-\tBuild a model to predict the volume of reserves in new wells.\n",
    "-\tSelect the oil wells with the highest estimated values.\n",
    "-\tChoose the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells.\n",
    "You have data on crude oil samples from three regions. The parameters for each oil well in each region are already known.\n",
    "Create a model that helps choose the region with the highest profit margin.\n",
    "Analyze the potential profits and risks using the bootstrapping technique\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditions:\n",
    "-\tOnly linear regression must be used for training the model.\n",
    "-\tDuring regional exploration, a study of 500 points is carried out, from which the best 200 points are selected to calculate profit.\n",
    "-\tThe budget for developing 200 oil wells is 100 million USD.\n",
    "-\tOne barrel of raw material generates 4.5 USD in revenue.\n",
    "-\tThe revenue per unit of product is 4,500 USD (the reserve volume is expressed in thousands of barrels).\n",
    "-\tAfter risk assessment, keep only the regions with a risk of loss below 2.5%. From those that meet the criteria, select the region with the highest average profit.\n",
    "-\tThe data is synthetic: contract details and well characteristics are not publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Description\n",
    "Geological exploration data for the three regions is stored in the following files:\n",

    "# 6. Conclusion\n",
    "After completing the analysis—which included data preprocessing, linear regression model training, metric validation, and bootstrapping risk analysis—Region 1 (geo_data_1) is identified as the best location for developing the project of 200 new oil wells.\n",
    "\n",
    "This conclusion is based on the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tPredictive model precision: Region 1 shows the highest precision, with an RMSE of 0.89\n",
    "-\tAverage profit: It achieves the highest average profit, with a profitability of $6'487,234.57\n",
    "-\tRisk of losses: It has the lowest risk, at 0.2%\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering these factors, it is recommended that OilyGiant proceed with the development of the 200 new oil wells in Region 1."
